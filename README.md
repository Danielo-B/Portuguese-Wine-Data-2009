# Portuguese-Wine-Data-2009

**Initial Project Proposal**

**Purpose of project**: By analyzing this dataset, I plan to get insights on the following:
A.      Based on physicochemical features of a bottle of wine, can we predict its quality rating? (Regression)
B.      Given all of the inputs (including the quality rating), can we classify a particular wine as red or white? (Classification)

**Data**: For this project, I will be using a Wine Quality data set. These data track various physicochemical features of both red & white wine and their ratings by wine experts. The data set covers wines that are a part of the  Portuguese "Vinho Verde" variety of wine. The wine are  Data are sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with no changes since 2009. 
 
**Initial thoughts about the data**: From first glance, I can see that the data is relatively clean and pretty standard. Just by glossing the csv file, it seems that all of the measures fall in a normal range. The data can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality.

**Reasoning**: I chose this because, I thought itâ€™d be a great first data set to explore. I can immediately see how both linear and logistic regression can be used as well as other ML algorithms. In terms of real-world applicable insights, I think it would be interesting to determine what chemical features tend to lead to a better bottle of glass.

*This project is to be used as a course project in Metis Introduction to Data Science course (Summer 2018 cohort).*
